## Customization

The Maze Solver program allows for extensive customization through command-line arguments. You can tailor your maze-solving experience with the following options:

- Adjust the number of rows and columns in the maze using the `-r` (rows) and `-c` (columns) flags:
   
   `python3 main.py -r 10 -c 15`

- Specify the maze generation color with `-color`

  `python3 main.py -color pink`


Mix and match these options to create the maze-solving adventure you desire. Enjoy customizing your maze experience with Maze Solver!

`python3 main.py -r 10 -c 10 -color orange`
